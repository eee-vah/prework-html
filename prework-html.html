        <p>Hi! I am a born in Texas, raised in Oklahoma girl. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Health and Social Studies, with a minor in Chinese, and a Master of Public Health degree in Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences from the University of Oklahoma. I've worked in data analysis for the last 6 years, begining as the Noncompliance Coordinator at the Oklahoma State Department of Health-HIV/STD Service Surveillance and Analysis Division and then as a Community Impact Data Analyst at Advantage Capital. I like data, coding, and solving puzzles while drinking milk tea with boba.</p>
